# Project: tde

## Project Overview

`tde` (tmux-based text IDE) is a simple bash script designed to streamline the management of project workspaces within `tmux` sessions. It allows users to open project directories in separate `tmux` windows, configure the number of panes within each window, and execute initial commands in specific panes.

The script operates in two primary modes:
1.  **New Session Mode:** When no project directories are specified on the command line, `tde` creates a new `tmux` session named `tde` and populates it with project workspaces defined in the `$HOME/.tde` configuration file.
2.  **Current Session Mode:** If project directories are provided as command-line arguments, `tde` adds new windows for these projects to the currently active `tmux` session.

`tde` is particularly useful for developers who rely on `tmux` for their workflow, providing a quick way to set up a consistent development environment for multiple projects.

## Building and Running

### Installation

To install `tde`, download the script and make it executable:

```bash
curl -L -o tde https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srackham/tde/main/tde
chmod +x tde
./tde --help
```

### Usage

The `tde` script is the main executable. Refer to its `--help` output or the `README.md` for detailed usage instructions, including options for specifying project directories, number of panes, and launch commands.

**Example (New Session Mode):**
Assuming `$HOME/.tde` contains:
```
/path/to/project1
/path/to/project2
```
Run:
```bash
tde
```
This will create a new `tmux` session named `tde` with windows for `project1` and `project2`.

**Example (Current Session Mode):**
Run from within an existing `tmux` session:
```bash
tde -p 2 -l '2:git status' /path/to/project3 /path/to/project4
```
This will add new windows for `project3` and `project4` to the current `tmux` session, each with 2 panes, and execute `git status` in the second pane.

### Testing

The project includes a test script `test-tde.sh` which performs dry-run tests of the `tde` script. To run the tests:

```bash
./test-tde.sh
```

This script executes `tde` with various arguments in dry-run mode (`--dry-run`) and compares the generated `tmux` commands against expected output.

## Development Conventions

*   **Language:** Bash scripting.
*   **Scripting Practices:** The `tde` script uses `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling.
*   **Testing:** Testing is performed using a dedicated bash script (`test-tde.sh`) that validates the `tmux` commands generated by `tde` in dry-run mode.
*   **Configuration:** Project directories for "New Session Mode" are configured in `$HOME/.tde`, with one directory path per line.
*   **Licensing:** The project is licensed under the MIT License.
